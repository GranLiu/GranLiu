### Ciao a tutti ðŸ‘‹

I received the B.S. degree in electronic information engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, and the B.S. degree (cum laude) in computer engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 2021.
I am currently a postgraduate student in communication and information engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
