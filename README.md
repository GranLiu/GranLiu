### Ciao a tutti ðŸ‘‹

## About me

- 2021~now Xi'an Jiaotong University, postgraduate in Communication and Information Engineering
- 2017~2021 Politecnico di Torino, B.S. in Computer Engineering (cum laude)
- 2017~2021 Tongji University, B.S. in Electronic Information Engineering

## Research
 
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on array signal processing, 5.5G wireless communication and numerical optimization.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on the simulations of Floquet analysis, and the research in the antenna efficiency for dense antenna arrays.
- ðŸ“« For any doubt, please e-mail at: <liu_xii@qq.com>

## Cooperation

- I'd like to cooperate with you guys to build an open source repo regarding signal processing, numerical optimization (interior-point method/ sequential quadratic programming), feel free to contact with me at any time!!
