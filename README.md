### Ciao a tutti ðŸ‘‹

## About me

- 2021 ~ now Xi'an Jiaotong University, postgraduate in Communication and Information Engineering
- 2017 ~ 2021 Politecnico di Torino, B.S. in Computer Engineering (cum laude)
- 2017 ~ 2021 Tongji University, B.S. in Electronic Information Engineering

## Research
 
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on array signal processing and NTN wireless communications.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on the beamforming design for large-scale arrays.
- ðŸ“« For any doubt, please e-mail at: <liu_xii@qq.com>

## Cooperation

- I'd like to cooperate with you guys to build an open source repo regarding signal processing, numerical optimization (interior-point method/ sequential quadratic programming), feel free to contact with me at any time!
